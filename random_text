'text': 'Table of Contents   our three businesses that is presented below is presented in a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs. Our operaƟng segment presentaƟon  below reﬂects revenues, direct costs and sales and markeƟng expenses that correspond to and are directly aƩributable to each of our three businesses. We  also uƟlize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each of our three businesses in the discussion below. Consistent with our internal management reporƟng processes, research and development expenses, general and administraƟve expenses, stock-based  compensaƟon expenses, amorƟzaƟon of intangible assets, certain other expense allocaƟons, acquisiƟon related and other expenses, restructuring expenses,  interest expense, non-operaƟng expenses, net and provision for income taxes are not aƩributed to our three operaƟng segments because our management  does not view the performance of our three businesses including such items and/or it is impracƟcable to do so. Refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to  Certain Charges” below for addiƟonal discussion of certain of these items and Note 9 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included  elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for a reconciliaƟon of the summaƟons of total segment margin as presented in the discussion below to total income before  income taxes as presented per our condensed consolidated statements of operaƟons for all periods presented. Constant Currency PresentaƟon Our internaƟonal operaƟons have provided and are expected to conƟnue to provide a signiﬁcant porƟon of each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses. As  a result, each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will conƟnue to be aﬀected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against  major internaƟonal currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the eﬀects of foreign  currency rate ﬂuctuaƟons, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Quarterly Report using constant currency.  To present this informaƟon, current and comparaƟve prior period results for enƟƟes reporƟng in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S.  Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in eﬀect on May 31, 2023, which was the last day of our prior ﬁscal year) rather than the actual exchange  rates in eﬀect during the respecƟve periods. For example, if an enƟty reporƟng in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on February 29,  2024 and February 28, 2023, our ﬁnancial statements would reﬂect reported revenues of $1.08 million in the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal 2024 (using 1.08 as the  month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.05 million in the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal 2023 (using 1.05 as the month-end average exchange rate  for the period). The constant currency presentaƟon, however, would translate the results for each of the ﬁrst nine months of ﬁscal 2024 and 2023 using the  May 31, 2023 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent  change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency. 26'}
